	<h1>Boggle API</h1>

	<p>
		This Boggle service keeps track of a set of users, a set of active and completed games, and exactly one pending game.
	</p>

	<p>
		The API makes uses user tokens for authentication.  User tokens are strings that are unique and extremely
		difficult to guess.  This implies that they must be long and randomly generated.  (A good way to generate such a token
		in C# is with Guid.NewGuid().)
	</p>

	<p>
		The API also makes use of game IDs to identify games.  Game IDs are strings that are unique, short, and embeddable
		in the path portion of URLs.  Strings made from small, consecutively generated integers are good for this purpose.
	</p>

	<p>
		A user token is valid if it is non-null and identifies a user.  A game token is valid if it is
		non-null and identifies a game.
	</p>

	<p>
		The pending game has a game ID.  If one player belongs to the pending game, it also has a user ID and a requested time limit.
		Think of it as a game that is waiting for a second player to join.  There is always exactly one pending game.
	</p>

	<p>
		An active or completed game consists of:
		<ul>
			<li>A unique game token.</li>
			<li>
				A game state that is either "active" (game currently being played) or "completed" (game for which time
				has expired).  Any number of games can be active and/or completed.
			</li>
			<li>
				The user tokens of the first and second players to join the game.
			</li>
			<li>
				The 16-character string that represents the contents of the game board.
			</li>
			<li>
				The time limit of the game, in seconds.
			</li>
			<li>
				The time remaining in the game, in seconds.
			</li>
			<li>
				The current scores of the two players.
			</li>
			<li>
				Lists of word/score pairs for the two players.  A word/score pair consists of a word that was played and the
				score received for that word.  The words appear in the order in which they were played.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		The exact response to undefined or malformed HTTP requests is server-dependent and is not specified in this API,
		except to note that some sort of error status code will be included in the response.
	</p>

	<p>
		The response status code 500 (InternalServerError) is used to report, among other things, unhandled exceptions in the
		service.  Sometimes, trying the same service call again will succeed, depending on the nature of the error.

	<h2>Make User</h2>

	<p>
		Create a new user.

		<ul>
			<li>
				If Nickname is null, or when trimmed is empty or longer than 50 characters,
				responds with status 403 (Forbidden).
			</li>
			<li>
				Otherwise, creates a new user with a unique user token and the trimmed Nickname.  The returned user token
				should be used to identify the user in subsequent requests.  Responds with status 200 (Ok).
			</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Join Game</h2>

	<p>
		Join a game.
		<ul>
			<li>
				If UserToken is invalid, TimeLimit < 5, or TimeLimit > 120,
				responds with status 403 (Forbidden).
			</li>
			<li>
				Otherwise, if UserToken is already a player in the pending game,
				responds with status 409 (Conflict).
			</li>
			<li>
				Otherwise, if there are no players in the pending game, adds UserToken as the first player
				of the pending game, and the TimeLimit as
				the pending game's requested time limit.  Returns an object as illustrated below containing the pending game's game ID.
				Responds with status 200 (Ok).
			</li>
			<li>
				Otherwise, adds UserToken as
				the second player.  The pending game becomes active and a new pending game with no players
				is created.   The active game's time limit is the integer average of the time limits
				requested by the two players.  Returns an object as illustrated below
				containing the new active game's game ID (which should be the
				same as the old pending game's game ID).  Responds with status 200 (Ok).
			</li>
